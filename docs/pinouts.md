# R51 Pinouts

This page documents the pinouts for the ECU's related to this project.

## AV Control Unit Pinout

The R51 AV Control Unit (head unit) has 7 connectors. They're labeled in the
service manual as M42, M43, M44, M45, M46, M69, and M70. Pins on the connectors
are labeled 1 through 119. I've attempted to document their relevant
functionality here.

The following housings or harness parts are assumed to be compatible. This is
pending confirmation.

| Connector | Pin | Housing      | Harness or Alternate Part     | 
| --------- | --- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| M42       |  20 |              | ["Upgraded" Metra 70-7552]    |
| M43       |  12 |              |                               |
| M44       |   3 |              | [Metra 40-NI12]               |
| M45       |  24 | TE 1376103-1 |                               |
| M46       |  16 | TE 1376106-1 |                               |
| M69       |  12 | TE 1379675-5 | [Metra 70-7554], TE 1379675-1 |
| M70       |  32 | TE 1473799-1 |                               |

The "upgraded" 70-7552 is not a Metra product but contains all the necessary
wires to connect to the stock harness. There are extras, particularly if your
system is equipped with the Bose sound system. I recommend using a pin removal
tool to remove the wires you do not need from this harness.

The Metra 70-7554 contains two pigtails: one for M69 for the Bose amplifier
pre-outs and one for M42. The M42 pigtail only has a few of its pins populated
and isn't suitable for use. You must either use the upgraded 70-7552 or
purchase additional terminals and crimp your own.

The pre-amp pigtail does not contain an amp-on wire. I recommend you use a pin
removal tool to remove one of the wires from the included M42 connector and
insert it for your amp-on wire.

### Connector M42

Contains wires for the speakers, accessor power, dash illumination, and
steering switch. The speaker terminals are not connected for R51s equiped with
the Bose amplifier.
